# Carrier board for displays of the DOGMxxxxA series.

These DOGM text displays are available in variants with 1x8 (EA DOGM081x-A), 2x16 (EA DOGM162x-A) 
and 3x16 characters (EA DOGM163x-A). The carrier board is suitable for all three variants.

This board should support all backlights (white, yellow/green, blue, red, amber, rgb full color),
but only amber was tested. The display must be connected with 3.3V.
The data transmission to the display takes place via the SPI protocol.
